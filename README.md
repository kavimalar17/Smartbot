SmartBot : A bluetooth controlled grass cutting machine using LPC2129 and HC-05 module (SMARTBOT)
An ARM7-based smart robotic system designed for wireless navigation and remote blade control. Powered by the NXP LPC2129 microcontroller, this robot interfaces with a custom Android Bluetooth application to execute mobility commands while featuring a high-priority hardware interrupt system to instantly toggle a cutting blade mechanism for safety and control.

🚀 Features
Wireless Control: Full motion control (Forward, Backward, Left, Right) managed remotely via an Arduino Bluetooth Controller mobile app.
Persistent Status Display: A 16x2 character LCD dynamically updates the current operational status with a smooth, scrolling initialization welcome screen.
Hardware Interrupt Safety: Uses the EINT0 external interrupt to instantly toggle the cutting blade mechanism (simulated via LED indicators) independently of the main firmware loop.
Dedicated Driver System: Utilizes an L293D H-Bridge motor driver to handle the high-current demands of dual DC motors safely.

📌 Pin Mapping & Configuration
1. Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)
The LCD is operated in 8-bit parallel interface mode:

Data Lines (DB0 - DB7): P0.2 to P0.9 (0xFF << 2)
Enable (E): P0.10
Register Select (RS): P0.11
2. L293D Motor Driver Connections
Motor 1 & 2 Inputs: P0.12, P0.13, P0.14, P0.15
3. UART0 (HC-05 Bluetooth Module)
TXD0 / RXD0: P0.0 and P0.1 configured via PINSEL0
4. Blade Interrupt Mechanism
External Interrupt 0 (EINT0): P0.16 (Configured via PINSEL1)
Blade Status Indicator (LED0): P0.17

💻 Firmware Architecture
The firmware is written in embedded C targeting the LPC2129 architecture. It is structured into distinct modular blocks:

ext_int0_isr(): Fast Vector Interrupt Service Routine (__irq) assigned to Slot 0. It instantly intercepts standard program execution when the EINT0 pin is triggered to flip the blade's operational state (start ^= 1).
UART Communication Pipeline: Configured with a 9600 Baud Rate (U0DLL = 97) and 8N1 frame format to continuously parse incoming serial character streams.
Precision Delay Engine: Leverages the internal Timer 0 (T0) register block to generate precise millisecond timing delays required for steady LCD signaling and motor stride intervals.

📱 Bluetooth Remote Mapping
The robot listens for standard character packets terminating with an 'S' wrapper packet string format:

🛠️ How to Compile & Flash
Software Framework: Open the project file in Keil uVision IDE.
Target Setup: Ensure the target selection is configured for the LPC2129 device under the ARM compiler toolchain.
Build: Click Build Target (F7) to output the production .hex binary file.
Flashing: Use Flash Magic utility or an appropriate JTAG debugger to interface with the LPC2129 bootloader configuration over an RS-232 serial interface to write the flash memory.
